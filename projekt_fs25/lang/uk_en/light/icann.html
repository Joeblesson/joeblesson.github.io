            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is a non-profit organisation formed 
                in 1998 to oversee the internet's unique identifiers (like domains and IP addresses). While ICANN 
                doesn't control the content displayed on the Internet, it ensures the smooth operating of the 
                Internet by managing DNS and IP <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.

                <br><br>

                Because it would be painstaking to remember strings of numbers for every website you want to 
                visit, the Domain Name System (or DNS) was created to simplify the experience for users by 
                translating IP adresses to letters. Theses "DNSes" are sold by so-called "registrars", selling 
                them for whatever price they find is right. ICANN makes contracts with such registries and has a 
                system recognising these registries to keep them in order<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.

                </div>

            <p>
                ICANN was created in 1998 in response to a U.S. goverment initiative to privatise the DNS (Domain Name System). 
                In January 1998, the U.S. Commerce Department's NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) 
                proposed creating a new nonprofit to manage Internet names and addresses.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> ICANN was then incorporated in California 
                on September 30, 1998.

                <br><br>

                

                <strong>Key events:</strong> <br><br>
                <strong>-1998:</strong> ICANN is formed under a contract to manage the DNS root zone and IP address allocation.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <br><br>

                

                <strong>-1999:</strong> ICANN negotiates a contract with the U.S. Department of Congress. Jon Postel's IANA duties were given to 
                ICANN (Postel was well-respected and had managed the names and addresses until his death in 1998).<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><br><br>

                <strong>-2006-2009:</strong> The U.S. government renews ICANN's contract. In 2008-09 ICANN signed an Affirmation of Commitments 
                with the U.S. commerce Dept. which required it to hold periodic accountability reviews to ensure that they're in step.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <br><br>

                <strong>-2011-13:</strong> ICANN distributed the last IPv4 address blocks by February 2011. In June of that year, ICANN's Board voted 
                to remove most restrictions on new gTLDs (Generic Top-Level Domain). <a href="#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> <br>
                In 2013, the ICANN leaders signed the Montevideo Statement calling for the globalisation of internet governance after it 
                was revealed that the NSA (National Security Agency) had been spying on users.<a href="#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><br><br>

                <strong>-2016:</strong> On October 1, 2016, ICANN took full control of the IANA functions and the U.S goverment offically
                gave up their control over them. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> ICANN is however still subject to California State Law, as it was incorporated there.

            <h2>Role in Internet Governance</h2>

            <div id="rir_coverage" class="image">
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Regional_Internet_Registries_world_map.svg" alt="International Coverage of the RIRs" width="300">

                </div>

            <p>
                <strong>- DNS Management:</strong> ICANN coordinates the DNS root zone, which sits at the top of the Internet's hierarchical name system. 
                It approves new top-level domains (TLDs) and works with registries to add or remove entries from the root zone.<a href="#8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> For example, when a new 
                gTLD (like .app or .xyz) or ccTLD (like .ch or .de) is made, ICANN updates the root zone file so that the domain becomes 
                reachable worldwide. 
                
                <br><br>

                <strong>- IP Address Allocation:</strong>  ICANN manages the global IP address pool. It allocates large blocks of IPv4 and IPv6 
                addresses to the five Regional Internet Registries (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, LACNIC, AFRINIC). These RIRs then allocate addresses to 
                Internet Service Providers and organizations in their regions. <a href="#9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Notably, on February 3, 2011 ICANN allocated the last remaining unassigned 
                IPv4 blocks to these RIRs.

                <br><br>

                <strong>- Protocol Parameter Registries</strong> Working with the IETF, ICANN maintains registries of protocol parameters. 
                These include port number assignments (e.g. HTTP on 80), DNS record types, and many other numeric identifiers defined in RFCs.
